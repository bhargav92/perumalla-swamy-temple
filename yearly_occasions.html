            <div class="col-12 col-sm-12 col-md-7 col-lg-8">
              <p>Vaikuntha Ekadashi (Sanskrit: वैकुण्ठ एकादशी, lit. 'Eleventh day of Vaikuntha') is a Hindu occasion and festival. </p>
              <p>Vaikuntha refers to the abode of the Hindu preserver deity, Vishnu. Vaishnavas consider the feet of Vishnu to be Vishnupada, or Parama Padam (Ultimate feet), as it is regarded to be the realm for Vishnu and his devotees to reside in the suddha-sattva, or the supreme state of purity and goodness.</p>
              <p>It is primarily observed by Vaishnavas, who regard it to be a special ekadashi. It coincides with Mokshada Ekadashi or Putrada Ekadashi. It is observed on the 11th lunar day of the waxing lunar fortnight of the solar month of Dhanu. This falls between 16 December and 13 January in the Gregorian calendar.</p>
            </div>
          </div>
          <div class="mb-4">
            <p>Vaishnavas (Devotees of Vishnu) believe that ‘Vaikuntha Dvaram’ (the gate to Vaikuntha) is opened on this day. The Margashirsha Shukla Paksha Ekadashi in the Lunar calendar is known as a 'Mokshada Ekadashi.' Special prayers from the Vedas, Naalayira Divya Prabandham, Sri Vaikuntha Gadhyam, as well as the Vaikuntha Dvara Puja, Prakarothsvam (Sri Veli), Oonjal Seva (swing pooja), Oonjal Prabhandham, yagnas, discourses, and speeches are arranged at Gajulamandyam on this auspicious day.</p>
          </div>
          <div class="mb-4">
            <h6 class="fw-600 mb-3">Legend</h6>
            <p>The origin of Vaikuntha Ekadashi is mentioned in a legend of the Padma Purana. There was once an asura named Murāsura, who was a nightmare to the devas, owing to a boon he had received from Brahma. They sought the assistance of Vishnu, who fought against the asura in a battle, but were unable to defeat him. He travelled to a cave called Simhavati in the vicinity of Badarikashrama, where he was pursued by Murāsura. There, Vishnu summoned Yogamaya, a goddess created from his divine energy, who slew the asura. Vishnu, who was pleased, offered the goddess the epithet 'Ekadashi', and declared that she would be capable of vanquishing the sins of all the people of Earth. In Vaishnava tradition, it is held all those who observe a fast on the occasion and worship Ekadashi would attain Vaikuntha. Thus came into being the first Ekadashi, which was a Dhanurmasa Shukla Paksha Ekadashi.</p>
